# Escape from Cnossus

Try your luck navigating thru the ancient labyrhint of Cnossus, fighting your
way to freedom.

How to play:

* Move around using WASD or the arrow keys.
* Consume food to restore your life with keys 1, 2 and 3
* Bring some light to see further with keys 4, 5 and 6

The game is turn-based. Enemies will have a turn after you move. Some of them
will run from you. Some will hunt and poison you.

You can only carry one food and one light until you find a bag.

Armour can be picked for extra defense.

Weapons increase your attack and you will always pick a better weapon if one is
found.
